# Solar Irradiance Forecasting

The goal of this project is to develop a solution for short-term irradiance forecasting using historical data. Irradiance is the amount of solar energy that reaches the earthâ€™s surface per unit area. This irradiance is the basis for the calculation of overall power production capacity; forecasting irradiance allows you to forecast production. Accurate irradiance forecasting is essential for renewable energy generators, especially solar power plants, to optimize their energy production and meet regulatory requirements.

In Australia, renewable energy generators are incentivized to provide 5-minute ahead forecasts. These forecasts are then aggregated by the grid to estimate when shortages or excess may occur and curtail plants accordingly. It is expected that similar regulations will soon be implemented in other markets and regions.

The objective is to leverage the various historical data provided in the *"A comprehensive dataset for the accelerated development and benchmarking of solar forecasting methods"* dataset to build a solution that can accurately forecast irradiance for the next 20 minutes.
